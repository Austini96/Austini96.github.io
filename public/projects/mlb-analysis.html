                    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
                    <p>For this data challenge, your goal is to use new baseball data on bat speed and swing length to analyze some aspect of the pitcher/batter interaction. We provide pitch-level data from Baseball Savant for 346,250 Major League Baseball plate appearances from 4/2/2024 to 6/30/2024, including relevant Statcast data along with bat speed and swing length on pitches with a swing tracked. Data from the second half of the season will be added after the conclusion of the regular season. Your analysis should involve bat speed and swing length to study any topic related to the batter, pitcher, or batter-pitcher interaction during an at bat.</p>
                    <p>Since these data are new, there are a variety of topics that have not previously been studied. Below are a few example topics. However, we note that this list is far from exhaustive. Participants should feel free to study any aspect of the batter, pitcher, or batter-pitcher interaction that interests them, provided that bat speed and swing length are used in the analysis in some meaningful way.</p>
                    <h3 id="proposal">1-1. Proposal</h3>
                    <p>Questions:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Define which variables determine a home run attempt (swing velocity, angle etc.)</li>
                        <li>Find distribution of numerical variables that constitute home run attempt</li>
                        <li>Transform events variable to make a separate variable determining home run attempts</li>
                        <li>Fit various classification models - What score, innings, batting counts, out counts, and runners are related to successful home runs</li>
                        <li>Find a trend related to home run attempts</li>

                    <h3 id="factors">2-1. Factors influencing a home run</h3>
                    <p>Since home run attempt includes both success and failure, we decided to count two simple factors:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Bat speed</b> : how fast a batter swings their bat</li>
                        <li><b>Swing length</b> : distance captured from start of a swing to an impact point</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3 id="threshold">2-2. Setting optimal threshold</h3>
                    <p>Since we have set the standards of a home run attempt, we have to decide the threshold for each of them to see from what point should we consider that the batter tried to hit a home run. For this, we took the following steps:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Create an <b>ROC curve</b> comparing home runs against bat speed and swing length</li>
                        <li>Calculate <b>Youden index</b> using sensitivity and specificity at all possible threshold values, where $$ J = \max\{\text{sensitivity}(t) + \text{specificity}(t) - 1\} $$</li>

                    <p>With the above steps, we got the optimal threshold of 72.65 mph for bat speed and 7.05 ft for swing length to create our response variable of <code>home_run_attempt</code>. The graph below shows the distribution of home runs for bat speed and swing length along with their optimal thresholds.</p>

                    <p>In terms of variable selection, we first started off by picking 30 potentially significant variables to predict home run attempts, including game situation (inning, outs), pitch characteristics (release position, velocity), and batter/pitcher attributes.</p>
                    <p>Then, we have tried multiple approaches for variable selection method:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Forward stepwise selection</b> using BIC</li>
                        <li><b>Backward stepwise selection</b> using BIC</li>
                        <li><b>Recursive Feature Elimination</b> (RFE) with 5-fold CV</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The table below is the result:</p>
                    <div class="table-container">
                    <table class="data-table">
                    <thead>
                    <tr><th>Variable Selection Method</th><th>Number of features</th></tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                    <tr><td>Forward Selection</td><td>9</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Backward Selection</td><td>9</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>RFE</td><td>2</td></tr>
                    </tbody>
                    </table>
                    </div>
                    <p>Forward and backward stepwise selection method provided the same number of features, but we decided to use backward selection, since it had a lower BIC. Even though RFE would be a very great approach for a variable selection, it gave too few variables this time, so we decided to not use this method.</p>
                    <p>Below are the list of final selected features:</p>
                    <ul>

                    <p>Since <b>mixed effects model</b> was the best performing model, we decided to take a further look at its result to examine significant factors of home run attempts.</p>

                    <p>The chart below has the list of ten batters with the highest home run success rate among those who are above 75% quantile range in the number of making home run attempts. This filter is set to show major batters who are most likely to play the whole game.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>After looking at this chart, another questions came up, which is: "Does higher bat speed and swing length lead to better home run success rate?" To answer the question, we have set the hypothesis as below:</p>
                    <div class="hypothesis-box">
                        <b>Hypothesis:</b> <b>Larger swing length and bat speed</b> will contribute to <b>higher home run success rate</b>
                    </div>
                    <div class="project-image-row">

                    </div>
                    <p>Looking at the charts above, we can see that the bat speed and swing length does not actually seem to correlate as much to the home run success rate as we have expected. This might mean couple of things:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>There might be an optimal range to have a better successful home run rate than a "higher is better" kind of relationship.</li>
                        <li>The timing and the point of contact might matter more significantly than just a bat speed and a swing length.</li>
                    </ol>
